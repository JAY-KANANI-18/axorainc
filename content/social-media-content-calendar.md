### **Tuesday - Industry Problem**

**LinkedIn:**
```
78% of online shoppers abandon their search if they can't find what 
they're looking for in 3 clicks.

For tile and design products, this number is even higher. Why?

❌ "Modern blue tile" returns 10,000 results
❌ Customers don't know technical terms
❌ Describing patterns with words is impossible

The solution? Visual search powered by AI.

### **Wednesday - How It Works**

**LinkedIn (with infographic):**
```
How does AI find similar tiles from a photo? 🤖

Here's what happens in the 2 seconds after you upload an image:

1️⃣ Image preprocessing & enhancement
2️⃣ Feature extraction (colors, patterns, textures)
3️⃣ Neural network analysis
4️⃣ Similarity matching across database
5️⃣ Ranked results delivered

The same technology that powers facial recognition—applied to tile 
design.

### **Thursday - Industry News Commentary**

**LinkedIn:**
```
Interesting: [Industry Report] just released data showing 45% of tile 
purchases now start with mobile image search.

This isn't surprising. Customers see inspiration on Pinterest, 
Instagram, friends' homes—then want to buy.

Businesses without visual search capabilities are missing nearly half 
their potential customers.

The shift is happening NOW.
